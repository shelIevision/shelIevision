"Finished as fast as a Gallimimus!"

HELLO!! THIS WON'T BE TOO FANCY FOR NOW, SORRY! i'm quite lazy ^_^;

anybody can sit with me, if you're goinng to be shippy i dont mind so long as it's not darkship, comship and proship! which honestly are all in the same category and should be kept far far away from me! obviously i have a preference (shellevision.. giggles) but anybody is welcome to interact or just sit with me! and if youre just sitting with me for the sake of needing someone to sit with, thats fine too! i love sitting with people it brings me great joy

FAIR WARNING! i have a tendency to go completely quiet at random intervals, if i suddenly stop talking to you, it's not a personal gripe i just get very awkward and would rather just sit in silence while i do other things, just know your company is always appreciated. HOWEVER if you whisper me, i'm bound to answer eventually, and if i don't, it's not on purpose! sometimes i check my game too late and i can no longer click your profile. ALSO i am NEW TO THE DANDYS WORLD COMMUNITY! IF IM DOING OR SAYING SOMETHING WRONG JUST TELL ME SO I CAN BETTER MYSELF! if i am accidentally liking something considered heavily problematic, explain it to me. please and thank you!

dni if you're proship or strictly nsfw, i don't bide with either of those things, thanks!
