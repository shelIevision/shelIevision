"Is my shell chipped?"

HELLO!! REDOING THIS AS OF 1/11/2025 BECAUSE IM NOT SATISFIED WITH THE ORIGINAL !

C*H (cuddle and hide) & W2i (whisper to interact) are HIGHLY reccommended and preferred. yes i am one of those people who get on this game and just tab out for long intervals of time to do other things, sometimes i can be more active but usually you'll just find me sitting around in one of my little areas. never be afraid to interact, i enjoy the company or the whispers when i do check them.

if i see someone with c*h in their name i will sometimes run up to them and sit down, that is if i'm not feeling too terribly shy. see i kind of hesitate to run up to people and sit with them myself because i feel as though i am being a nuisance or that they think im sitting with them purely for shippy reasons. that just isnt the case! i'll sit with anyone in my fandoms as long as they let me. if i crown you that probably means im trying to warm up to you and imply i'd like to sit with you but im too much of a pussy to say it.

from time to time i do like sitting with characters im fond of. if i see an astro or a vee with c*h in their name trust you WILL be dealt with. /pos

i have like 500 interests, the most prominent at the moment being dandys world, ultrakill (i am litally v1), roblox games in general (regrev, phighting, etc) and beastars. there are definitely a LOT more but for the moment those are the ones that captivate me the most.

i am both an artist and an oc x canon warrior, if you don't like that i DO NOT CARE! im not necessarily a yume(?) but honestly it might get to that point one day, either way i'm not too worried about it. just something i thought i'd share.

TAKE INSPO FROM MY CHARACTERS! SEEING PEOPLE BE INSPIRED BY MY CREATIONS AND IMPLIMENTING THE FEATURES INTO THEIR OWN FILLS ME WITH GLEE! however do not copy my shit color-for-color and detail-for-detail. treat it like homework, get the answer but improvise and do your own creative thinking. 

^ MY PROCESS IS LIKE.. i use imagecolorpicker.com for the base colors (if its not an oc, i color pick from an image of the character) and then i save a picture of the pony and go on canva.com to run it through a filter and adjust it to my liking, save image and back to color picker i go. that's my current progress, i think the canva filters make things look so nice. do note that color picking from the filtered pony will not always look 100% the way you want, the shading/shadows on certain areas make it look different simply because its filtered and not the actual shading color you'll get.

if i go quiet on you while we're sitting(?) together, please do not take it personally. i love sitting in silence with people i find it more comfortable that way, and i'd rather just run out of things to say than to keep trying to say somethting awkward every 5 seconds. it's just how i am and if you don't like it, completely understandable! everyone has different preferences when socializing and there is nothing you can do to change that.

that's all, thanks for stopping by to listen to my new-and-improved yapfest! check out my main if you have the chance (the @ is in my bio!) and you can see my socials there.
